    <h1>Thanks for reading by applilcation</h1>
      <p> I quicky put this here as a demo for the News Labs Junior software engineer job application</p>

      <p> I just need a few more hours to demonstrate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Node.js development skills</li>
        <li> Service Oriented Architecture  consuming RESTful web services via HTTP</li>
       <li>Test driven development: unit and integration</li>
       </ul>
       <p>I just need a few more hours!</p>
       <p>I only found out about the job a few days ago - and prioritised getting the application form submitted before the deadline. </p>
       <p>Demo's are nearly done.</p>
       <p>Please check back here tomorrow morning Tuesday 4th April</p>
       <p>Thanks so much for your understanding</p>
